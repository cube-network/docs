# Full Ethereum Protocol Compatibility


Cube believes that Ethereum is the industry standard for blockchain applications development. To attract more high-quality Dapps projects and developers to join the Cube
ecosystem, Cube has implemented the full Ethereum protocol in the settlement layer.
The virtual machine Cube is not only fully compatible with EVM, but also keeps
up with the latest EIP’s so that developers can directly deploy the existing Dapps on
Ethereum to Cube. All the development tools developed on Ethereum, including Wallet,
Solidity, Remix, Truffle and Hathat, can also be directly used on the Cube Chain.
Cube is also compatible with almost all of the RPC interfaces of Ethereum, so developers
can switch to Cube’s application development at no cost and get the rewards for Cube’s
ecosystem development.
